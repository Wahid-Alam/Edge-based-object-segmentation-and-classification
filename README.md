# Edge-based-object-segmentation-and-classification
In this group project, we implement segmentation and classification in tow stages. In part 1, we write the script to segment and classify washers from a given image by the instructor. Next, we generalize our algorithm to implement on several other images contamined with differnt kinds of deformation and hand-written backgrounds.
